Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at the Univeristy of British Columbia (UBC) CS advised by [Vered Shwartz](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~vshwartz/) and [Raymond NG](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/raymond-ng) in the [Natural Language Processing group](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/lci/research-groups/natural-language-processing/). 

The goal of my research is to develop robust and safe AI models that move beyond pattern recognition to achieve a deeper, context-sensitive understanding of the world. Specifically, I evaluate and improve critical reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities (text, images, videos) - which are fundamental for safe and effective deployment in real-world applications.

My focusing on the following interconnected areas:

➋ **Robustness to Expectation-Violating Scenarios**  
I design benchmarks and models that adapt to surprising or expectation-violating events, which is crucial for **real-world safety**. 
My work [Black Swan](https://blackswan.cs.ubc.ca/) introduces a framework for abductive and defeasible reasoning in unpredictable video settings, enabling models to revise beliefs with new evidence.
I am currently working on adapting models to be resilient to such scenarios.

➌ **Feedback Driven Learning**  
To scale complex capabilities such as creativity, I have explored feedback-driven training paradigms[Small But Funny](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.706.pdf) and control. I am currently exploring the role of multi-aspect feedback in generation.

➊ **Grounded Reasoning**  
I have developed models that infer real-world events and object dynamics using world knowledge. This includes reasoning over interconnected events in text [COMET-M](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.861.pdf), event coreference [BeforeAfter](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.125), and grounded vision-language understanding in [VLC-BERT](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Ravi_VLC-BERT_Visual_Question_Answering_With_Contextualized_Commonsense_Knowledge_WACV_2023_paper.pdf). 

➍ **Inclusive Models**  
I have worked on valuating vision-language models in [multicultural settings](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.385/) and benchmarking the understanding of cultural norms in LLMs ([CulturalBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02677)). 

Before coming to UBC, I worked as an AI research engineer in the Machine Learning group at Eindhoven University of Technology. Together with an amazing [team](https://github.com/orgs/openml/people) supervised by [Joaquin Vanschoren](https://joaquinvanschoren.github.io/home/#lab) I worked on research and development of open-source software for [open and automated machine learning](https://github.com/openml). I also worked with [Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/) on active learning and interpretability of NLP models. Prior to that, I graduated from M.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science at Eindhoven University of technology, the Netherlands, and B.E. in Computer Engineering from PSG college of Technology, Coimbatore, India.
