Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at the Univeristy of British Columbia (UBC) CS advised by [Vered Shwartz](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~vshwartz/) and [Raymond NG](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/raymond-ng) in the [Natural Language Processing group](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/lci/research-groups/natural-language-processing/). My research focuses on the development of algorithms aimed at improving the reasoning capabilities of language/vision-language models.

Before coming to UBC, I worked as an AI research engineer in the Machine Learning group at Eindhoven University of Technology. Together with an amazing [team](https://github.com/orgs/openml/people) supervised by [Joaquin Vanschoren](https://joaquinvanschoren.github.io/home/#lab) I worked on research and development of open-source software for [open and automated machine learning](https://github.com/openml). I also worked with [Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/) on active learning and interpretability of NLP models. Prior to that, I graduated from M.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science at Eindhoven University of technology, the Netherlands, and B.E. in Computer Engineering from PSG college of Technology, Coimbatore, India.
