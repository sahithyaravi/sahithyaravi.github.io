Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at the Univeristy of British Columbia (UBC) CS advised by [Vered Shwartz](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~vshwartz/) and [Raymond NG](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/raymond-ng) in the [Natural Language Processing group](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/lci/research-groups/natural-language-processing/). I frequently collaborate with [Leonid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/) in the Computer Vision group.

I work at the intersection of NLP, Vision and cognitively-inspired reasoning. Specifically, I evaluate and improve critical reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities (text, images, videos) - which are fundamental for safe and effective deployment in real-world applications such as embodied agents and AR/VR.

My recent work [Black Swan](https://blackswan.cs.ubc.ca/) evaluates models on abductive and defeasible reasoning in unpredictable video settings, testing whether models can revise their beliefs when presented with new evidence. In my ongoing work [SPIKE](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23433), I am working on post-training methods that teach VLMs to be revise beliefs and become resilient to such scenarios. 

If you are reading this and would like to collaborate on multimodal reasoning, robustness and post-training approaches feel free to reach out.
