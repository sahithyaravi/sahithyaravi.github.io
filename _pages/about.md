Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at the Univeristy of British Columbia (UBC) and the Vector Institute for AI advised by [Vered Shwartz](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~vshwartz/) and [Raymond NG](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/raymond-ng) in the [Natural Language Processing group](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/lci/research-groups/natural-language-processing/). I frequently collaborate with [Leonid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/) in the Computer Vision group.

I work at the intersection of NLP, Vision and cognitively-inspired reasoning. Specifically, I evaluate and improve critical reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities (text, images, videos) - which are fundamental for safe and effective deployment in real-world applications such as embodied agents and AR/VR. I have worked on several fundamental reasoning abilties inspired by how humans reason in the world such as causal, counterfactual and commonsense reasoning. I have also worked on cultural and social norm understanding in the past.

Recently, I have focused on the robustness of VLMs to unexpected scenarios and surprises. My recent work [Black Swan](https://blackswan.cs.ubc.ca/) evaluates models on how they explain and adapt in unpredictable video settings. In my ongoing work [SPIKE](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23433), I am working on post-training methods inspired by Bayesian Theory of Mind, that teach VLMs to be revise beliefs and become resilient to novel scenarios. 

If you would like to collaborate/discuss multimodal reasoning/robustness or PhD life at UBC or in general, I would like to connect X or via email.
